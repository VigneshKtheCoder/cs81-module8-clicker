1. Actually seeing the counter update live after using getelementbyid() and modifying the textContent made it click for me. It made DOM changes feel real and direct.

2. I just chose the ones that were recommended to me in the assignment. Those were pretty enjoyable and fascinating messages, so I just went with them.

3. There was a bug where when I clicked the button, it made the count go up to 1 for a split second, but then it went down to 0. That made it really frustrating so I used a code that prevented the server from reloading called preventdefault().

4. The personal twist I used was changing the background color every milestone. However, the smaller milestones have a lower intensity shade of red, while milestone 50 had dark red. milestone 100 has gray since it is the highest milestone though. 

5. Many games have this feature and even CPS tests have these kind of uses to determine the user's clicks per second. There are also clicker simulator games that use this feature as well.
